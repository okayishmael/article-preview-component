## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned that when using javascript to display hidden element block, you much have only one direct child element within it. If not all the direct children element with display block causing you style to look different(stack of top of each other).

- I learned how to implement relative and absolute values.

### Continued development

I have just moved from beginner's level to junior level in the frontend mentor challenge path. The junior level includes javascript in projects. So I am going to take [The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course) to get more understanding in JavaScript while I do challenges that contain it.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me understand the javascript I used in this project.
